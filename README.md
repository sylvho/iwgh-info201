US Prison Population: an Analysis
Jevandre Diaz, Patrick Groden, Sylvia Ho, Rebecca Xu

This project uses prison data, relayed through visualizations and analysis, to explore the growth and composition of the United States prison system. We are studying the data in four pieces; the overall prison population and incarceration rates over the last 40 years, overcrowding in prisons, the prison population under age 17, and the population of non-citizens in US prisons. In so doing, we aim to examine external effects on the US prison population, and what consequences they have had on the US prison system as a whole.
